# Introduction

This repo contains an example data model that is defined based on a mixture of SAREF and CIM definitions. In the current state the model is defined as an ontology in turtle format.

To work with and edit the model, several tools exist amongst which are:

- [Proptege](https://protege.stanford.edu/), which is open source
- [TopBraid Composer](https://archive.topquadrant.com/products/topbraid-composer/).
